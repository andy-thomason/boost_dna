# boost_dna 

This project is an investigation of making a boost-compatible DNA
database that can contain FASTA, FASTQ, SAM and BAM files in an efficient
format.

The database is supported by a suffix array and other indexing techniques
for extracting approximate matches in the minimum run-time.
